### Introduction

Do you struggle with making decisions?

### Deployed Link

### How to Set Up

1.  Clone this [repo](https://github.com/irmakerdem/colorandom).
2. `cd` into the directory.
3. Run `open index.html`.

### How to Use
- After opening the browser, click the *New Random Palette* button to generate a new palette. User may click as many times as they like.
- If a user likes a particular palette, they may save their selection to the *Saved Palettes Area* by clicking the *Save This Palette* button.
- If a user likes one particular color, they may "lock" that color by clicking anywhere near the lock icon. The icon will change to locked and a user can cycle through the randomly generated palettes until they find a selection they want to save.

### Future Features
- Create functionality to freeze locked color while still generating random unlocked colors.
- Add dropdown to provide options for palettes based on shared color attributes, for a more cohesive palette.
- Add delete button functionality to remove any unwanted palettes.

### Workflow
- With three team-members across two time zones, clear communication and scheduling were imperative. We used a [detailed spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qY4cgBmzv1QT-XvIO-s3bCS2HTzcMXfrMt3w1Su75Ak/edit#gid=0) to keep track of each task within each iteration.
- We also utilized daily morning stand-ups to check progress and ensure all team-members were informed of changes.
- We pair-programmed the entire project to maximize learning.
