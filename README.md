### Workflow

With three team-members across two time zones, clear communication and scheduling were imperative. We used a detailed spreadsheet to keep track of each task within each iteration. We also utilized daily morning stand-ups to check progress and ensure all team-members were informed of changes. We paired-programmed the entire project to maximize learning.
